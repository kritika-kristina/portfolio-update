                        <p>One of my extracurriculars is being in my school's drama class. I've acted in our annual play as the characters Gabrielle and Jessica. I've also took part in our annual Haunted House, where I played the Jack-in-the-Box. Being part of the drama class also taught me any things about what happens behind-the-scenes. I've made videos, found costumes, wrote advertising scripts, and created props for the play and Haunted House.</p>
